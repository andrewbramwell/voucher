  faq_list:
  - title: "Do I need an internet connection?"
    content: 'Yes, you will need internet access to receive an order. A 4G sim card is suitable for the Foodie store app but wifi is preferable.'

  - title: "What hardware is required?"
    content: 'You will require an Android phone running OS 10 or later for each branch registered with Foodie.'

  - title: "Do I need an existing website?"
    content: "Not necessarily, a Foodie online store can act as a ‘standalone’ website. If you do have a website it is easy to add an ‘order here’ button linked to your online store."

  - title: "Do I need my own domain?"
    content: "No, typically an online store is hosted on a foodie-delivery.com sub-domain."

  - title: "How long will it take to set up my online store?"
    content: "Once we have received all of the required setup information, we can usually have your online store up and running within 72 hours."

  - title: "Who manages my online store?"
    content: "Foodie is a self managed solution. We provide full system training prior to your store going live and unlimited support for the duration of the agreement."

  - title: "Can I accept Cash On Delivery payments?"
    content: "Yes, as long as there are enough on-demand riders in your vicinity who handle cash orders. Online payments are always the easier, more preferred option for the majority of riders."

  - title: "What are the payment methods available?"
    content: "Cash on delivery, Credit/debit card, QR Cash (Promptpay), Line Pay, True Wallet and Mobile Banking"

  - title: "Can Foodie integrate with our existing POS"
